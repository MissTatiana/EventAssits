-get the dashboard to function like the rest of the application
-figure out the routing and how everything is working

-MVC for events
-MVD for segments

-stylize the 404 page to my EventAssits branding

-the user collection need to be modified to display/add the events, or the events need to include the userid and be called that way
-how ever the users is getting the thing/awesome/dummy data is how you need to get the events data, and from the event, the same to get the segments
